Get the foundational knowledge you need to embark on your first voyage with Kubernetes, the world's most popular open-source container orchestration engine. Instructor Kim Schlesinger demonstrates how to create a Kubernetes cluster with Minikube, deploy a containerized application, and manage that application using Kubernetes. Along the way, she guides you through exercises that provide you with hands-on experience.

Learning objectives
- Review the basics of containers: container images, container registries, and container technologies like Docker.
- Get an overview of cloud-native technology and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
- Install Kubernetes and minikube on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Read and write Kubernetes YAML manifests and create a namespace with a YAML manifest.
- Deploy a containerized application and manage it using Kubernetes.
- Describe a pod and look at the event logs to troubleshoot issues.
- Spin up a BusyBox pod and use it to verify an application is working.
- Use kubectl to view the application logs of a pod.
- Assign your application an IP address using a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service.
- Set CPU and memory requests and limits on the containers in your pods.
- Explore the Kubernetes control plane and its different components, such as kube-apiserver, etcd, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, and cloud-controller-manager.
- Leverage security best practices.
